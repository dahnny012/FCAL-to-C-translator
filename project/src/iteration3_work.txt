The Fire Ferrets

Iteration 3 was mostly finished in remotely on github. We used a online task manager to manage
who would implement what classes and their parts into the parser.cpp. Josh took implemented
all the classes that were deemed to be Expr's. Danh took care of the rest. We both equally
contributed and fixed the bugs and errors in our code. We commented our code seperately.
Iteration 3 took place mainly over a course of a week. Initially Danh did most of his parts
while helping Josh do his. Josh worked remotely on SSH while Danh worked in Keller labs. We
communicated using a chat messenging application.

In the end the we could not finish in time. We did not anticipate the amount of debugging
that the code would require. But we did our best to make the all 3 files compile it will
only error on execute. We also divided the workload of creating the UML and doxyfying the code.
We will get those test cases back in iter4, believe it.
