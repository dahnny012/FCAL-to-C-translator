The Fire Ferrets

Iteration 4 was done jointly like iteration 3. We met up on the weekends
to implement the cppCode methods for all the classes. Danh dealt with 
everything not Expr's and Josh implemented it for Expr's.

Danh implemented the Matrix.h and Matrix.cpp in parallel remotely from
home. Debugging was a joint effort. Lastly, writing the my_code_1/2 samples
was split. Danh implemented the matrix multiplication test and Josh implemented
the while loop test.
