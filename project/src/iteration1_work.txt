Danh Nguyen
Josh Varghese
The Fire Ferrets

Iteration 1 was basically done this weekend in the keller labs. We were together saturday and sunday for the bulk of the edits to the code
 and making test cases. We were together for about 80% of the development and setting up test cases. This is the reason that most of the commits 
 are from danh. We would almost always work from his workspace. During monday and tuesday we worked mostly on debugging different aspects of the code.
 Test cases were worked on immediately after designing our code. Danh came up with using an array with regexs. A smart and modular approach that 
 makes our code faster and easier to understand. This makes our scan function much shorter than the scan function equivalent in wordcount.
 Danh ultimately fixed the infinite loop problem we were having and finished up two other failing test cases. Josh took care of the project file 
 structure and last minute bug fixes. Danh commented all the code to make it easier to understand for TA's.
 
 Our work was done together for the most part. Next iteration we will be giving eachother specific tasks to complete all throughtout the iteration
 as to not overload ourselves on one weekend like we did during this iteration.
