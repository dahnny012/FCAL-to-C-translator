Danh Nguyen
Josh Varghese
The Fire Ferrets

Iteration 2 was mostly finished in the lab session. We didn't have to make any changes. Josh took care of the dsl file and Danh worked on the
 makefile. We both worked on updating the keywords in labs and making our array better for searching. Josh finished up with last minute code fixes.
 Danh took care of a little compile error. It was an incorrectly placed endif. 
 
 Our code was already good from the fixes asked for in the last lab so there wasn't a lot of work necessary.
